You slowly opened your eyes and felt a sereve headache, half expecting to be still tied up in some remote warehouse.

Mildly surprised that your limbs were free, you sat up carefully.

You found yourself in the roof top of a worn down commerical building in downtown, and you immediately knew what happened.

You first met the 2 male vigilantes right here, both them and you were chasing the same lead.

Thought you were with the criminals, they attacked you. 1 against 2 wasn't a good odd when both of them were skillful fighters, and stronger than you. And especially so when they don't fight fair...

The older one held you by your arms from behind, while the younger one took off your belt.

You tried to kick him, but he caught your leg by the ankle. He took your taser out from your belt, pressed it against your thigh he caught in his other arm.

"Sleep tight", he said and pressed the button, tased you with your own taser. When you woke up, you were cuffed to the pipework here with your own cuffs, a patch of thigh skin burnt...

After that, although they realized you were not a criminal, they still thought you were in their way.

And you thought they were dumb, so you never got along with them.

Shook yourself off from the memory, you got up, and realized there were a pile of clothing beside you. They left you with a t-shirt, a mini-skirt, a pair of panties, and a pair of heels.
