You opened your eyes suddenly as if awaken from a bad dream, and remembered it was not a dream

And found yourself in a sitting position, arms and legs tied to a chair.

Your captor must have found you lying on the floor, and decided to tie you up this way.

You found yourself feeling less dizzy, you captor did not drugged you again after you fainted, which must be good.

[Pretent](fake/fake.md) to be unconscious and wait for the next move of your captor...

Un-tie yourself and [escape](escape/escape.md) now...
