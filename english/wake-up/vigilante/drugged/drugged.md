"Definiately not heavy for someone that tall..."

With your head hanged up side down behind the person carrying you, blood still filled with drugs flowed toward your brain...

"...id you notice how she found the criminals before we do, every ti..."

Your world [turn complete dark](..end/end.md) again.
