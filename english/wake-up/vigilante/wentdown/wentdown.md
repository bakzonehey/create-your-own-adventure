You opened your eyes suddenly as if awaken from a bad dream, and remembered it was not a dream.

You saw a pair of bare legs, and a cleavage revealed underneath unzipped leotard.

You found out you were looking at yourself, arms and legs tied up in a sitting position in a metal a chair.

Your captor must have found you lying on the floor, and decided to tie you up this way.

You found yourself feeling less dizzy, you captor did not drug you again after you fainted, which had to be a good sign.

[Pretent](../fake/fake.md) to be unconscious and wait for the next move of your captor...

Un-tie yourself and [escape](../escape/escape.md) now...
