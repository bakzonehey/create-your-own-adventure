You slowly opened your eyes and felt a sereve headache, half expecting to be still tied up in some remote warehouse.

Mildly surprised that your limbs were free, you sat up carefully.

You found yourself in the roof top of a worn down commerical building in downtown, and you immediately knew what happened.

You first met the 2 male vigilantes right here, both them and you were chasing the same lead.

Thought you were with the criminals, they attacked you. 1 against 2 wasn't a good odd when both of them were skillful fighters, and stronger than you. And especially so when they don't fight fair...

The older one held you by your arms from behind, while the younger one took off your belt.

You tried to kick him, but he caught your leg by the ankle. He took your taser out from your belt, pressed it against your thigh he caught in his other arm.

"Sleep tight", he said and pressed the button, tased you with your own taser. When you woke up, you were cuffed to the pipework here with your own cuffs, a patch of thigh skin burnt...

After that, although they realized you were not a criminal, they still thought you were in their way.

And you thought they were dumb, so you never got along with them.

Shook yourself off from the memory, you got up, and realized there were a pile of clothing beside you. They left you with a t-shirt, a mini-skirt, and a pair of heels.

"Not accepting nothing from you" you thought to yourself. And went for the stairs ignoring the civilian clothing.

It was near mid-night, no one was in the building. You went down to street level without incident. You left the building and entered the dark alley behind.

"You shouldn't come here dressed like that, at least put on some shoes"

You were startled by the voice came out behind you, and turned toward the voice.

"Oh is that really you? That vigilante lady?" the voice said when he saw the emblem on the left chest of your leotard.

"I bet she lost a fight, got stripped off and left unconscious here. Now she has to go home dressed like that!" Another voice said behind you.

"Now surrender, bitch!" The person in front of you said, while took out a pistol and pointed at you.
