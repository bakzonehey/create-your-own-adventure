As a vigilante, you normally would welcome the cover provided by such a dark alley.

But tonight you felt awlfully exposed in here. You just wished to reach your safe-house as soon as possible.

Not to mention the sewage and dirt you stepped onto with your bare feet.

"You shouldn't come here dressed like that, at least put on some shoes"

You were startled by the voice came out behind you, and turned toward the voice.

"Oh is that really you? That vigilante lady? And no mask too?" the voice said when he saw the emblem on the left chest of your leotard.

"I bet she lost a fight, got stripped off and left unconscious nearby. Now she has to go home dressed like this!" Another voice said behind you.

"Now surrender, bitch!" The person in front of you said, while took out a pistol and pointed at you.

Would you [gave up](surrender/surrender.md),

or [fight](fight/fight.md) despite the odds?
